# Spec 13 Validation: Command Surface Consolidation

## Executive Summary

- **Overall:** PASS — Gates A through F pass; no CRITICAL/HIGH issues, no `Unknown` Functional Requirements, all proof artifacts are accessible and reproducible, all changed core files are mapped, repository gates pass, and proof documents contain no credentials.
- **Implementation Ready:** **Yes** — the canonical command contract, complete invocation/next-step help guidance, safety behavior, maintained documentation, demos, and four-platform release archives are independently verified at `789c4ba`.
- **Requirements Verified:** 38/38 (100%).
- **Proof Artifacts Working:** 5/5 parent proof documents and every artifact class named by the task list (100%).
- **Files Changed vs Expected:** 79 files changed from baseline `7a62d22`; 16 core/runtime-impacting files map to Tasks 1-5, and 63 supporting test/doc/proof/script files have explicit requirement or core-file linkage. Unmapped core files: 0.

### Gate Results

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — severity blocker | PASS | No open CRITICAL or HIGH issues. |
| B — FR coverage | PASS | All 38 Functional Requirements below are `Verified`; no `Unknown` entries. |
| C — proof artifacts | PASS | All five proof documents are readable and their referenced CLI, test, demo, and release checks pass. |
| D — file integrity | PASS | All 16 core files map to Tasks 1-5; all 63 supporting files link to those tasks, proofs, or release verification. |
| E — repository compliance | PASS | `make verify`, focused Go tests, `make tui-verify`, demo, GoReleaser, formatting, lint, vet, and vulnerability gates pass. |
| F — secret safety | PASS | Proof scan found no real user paths, private keys, age identities, hosted tokens, GitHub tokens, bearer credentials, or authenticated URLs. |

## Coverage Matrix

### Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID/Name | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U1-FR1 — grouped root help | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:27-64`; `TestReleaseCommandTreeContract`; Task 1 proof lines 16-50. |

| U1-FR3 — canonical visible root set | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:51-55`; `internal/devspace/commands_test.go:101-116`. |
| U1-FR4 — removed root registrations | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands_test.go:151-188`; no workspace/TUI installer/version constructors remain registered. |
| U1-FR5 — `--version` retained | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:29-35`; `TestVersionFlagPrintsVersion`. |
| U1-FR6 — aggregate and verbose status | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:1096-1145`; Task 1 proof lines 77-123. |
| U1-FR7 — project status and JSON | Verified | `internal/devspace/output.go:281-292`; `internal/devspace/commands.go:1125-1139`; Task 1 proof lines 125-148. |
| U1-FR8 — concise invocation and next-step help | Verified | `TestCanonicalCommandHelpShowsInvocationAndNextSafeStep` checks 24 root/status/sync/project/env/setup/experimental paths for an exact common invocation and next safe step; the focused test and full suite pass at `789c4ba`. |
| U1-FR9 — bare groups show focused help | Verified | Group `RunE` help handlers in `internal/devspace/commands.go`; `TestReleaseCommandTreeContractProjectGroupShowsHelp`. |
| U1-FR10 — no aliases/deprecations/wrappers | Verified | Source scan finds no compatibility constructors, `Aliases`, or `Deprecated` fields; removed-path contract tests return unknown-command errors. |
| U2-FR1 — canonical sync namespace | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:420-673`; `TestSyncCommandSurface`; Task 2 proof lines 89-135. |
| U2-FR2 — remote capabilities and identity flags | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:571-673`; `TestSyncCommandRemoteCreateSetGet` and `TestSyncCommandRemoteSetHelpDocumentsCommitFlags`. |
| U2-FR3 — sync safety/domain behavior preserved | Verified | Full Go suite plus workspace sync/reconcile/access-role focused gates; Task 2 proof lines 61-72. |
| U2-FR4 — all workspace paths removed | Verified | `TestSyncCommandSurface` rejects workspace, workspace scan/push/remote; command-surface scanner passes. |
| U2-FR5 — explicit project actions | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:791-903`; `TestProjectCommandSurface`. |
| U2-FR6 — track remains non-destructive | Verified | `project track` reuses `AddProject`; full hardening suite and project command tests pass without project-content mutation. |
| U2-FR7 — untrack retains files/profiles | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:871-901`; `TestProjectUntrackCommandOutputRetainsSecrets`; Task 2 proof lines 166-172. |
| U2-FR8 — single/all project update safety | Verified | `internal/devspace/hardening_test.go:375-509`; missing/empty hydration, clean pull, dirty/detached/local/non-Git/no-remote skips pass. |
| U2-FR9 — removed project paths and bare help | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands_test.go:184-205,871-909`; removed paths fail and bare project renders help. |
| U2-FR10 — stable human/JSON contracts | Verified | `TestProjectCommandListJSONHasStableFieldNames`, sync JSON tests, project status JSON parse/ANSI checks; Task 2 proof lines 137-162. |
| U3-FR1 — `env write` is materialization path | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:947-967`; `TestEnvWriteMaterializesSelectedProfileSafely`. |
| U3-FR2 — env atomic/profile/state/mode safeguards | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands_test.go:242-305`; Task 3 proof lines 48-61. |

| U3-FR6 — setup plan/apply removed | Verified | `TestSetupCommandShowAndRunContract` rejects both paths; migration scanner passes. |
| U3-FR7 — hosted client-only surface | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:153-299`; `TestExperimentalCommandOwnsHostedServeAndMount`. |
| U3-FR8 — experimental mount/server with guards | Verified | `internal/devspace/commands.go:66-91,303-418,746-789`; public-bind/trusted-proxy and FUSE-free preview tests pass. |
| U3-FR9 — TUI installer removed | Verified | `internal/devspace/tui_install.go` and its installer-only tests are deleted; root contract rejects `tui`. |
| U3-FR10 — paired executables in every archive | Verified | `.goreleaser.yaml:41-56`; exact-HEAD snapshot archives for Linux/macOS amd64/arm64 each pass `scripts/verify-release-archives.sh`. |
| U3-FR11 — UI adjacent preference and fallback | Verified | `internal/devspace/ui.go:17-100`; adjacent/app-home/PATH/fallback tests pass; Task 4 proof lines 112-120. |
| U4-FR1 — task-oriented README | Verified | `README.md:166-240` presents capture, restore, maintain, and troubleshoot before `README.md:242-271` command reference. |
| U4-FR2 — maintained docs use canonical paths | Verified | `scripts/check-command-surface.sh` scans maintained Markdown including `docs/architecture/manifest-merge.md`, active demos, and linked capstone HTML; production scan passes. |
| U4-FR3 — isolated canonical demos | Verified | `scripts/demo-check.sh:40-186` uses temporary homes/workspaces; active tapes use temporary `DEVSPACE_HOME`; demo passes. |
| U4-FR4 — historical artifacts preserved | Verified | Changed-file review shows no prior completed SDD spec/audit/proof/validation artifacts modified; generated capstone reader is linked maintained output, not a historical source rewrite. |
| U4-FR5 — breaking-change release migration | Verified | `README.md:273-297` states intentional pre-1.0 clean break and provides the old-to-new table. |
| U4-FR6 — metadata-only product boundary | Verified | `README.md:182-205,269-271`, architecture docs, sync help, and proof workflows state source/dependencies/plaintext env/secret payloads are excluded. |
| U4-FR7 — full release gates | Verified | `make verify`, `make tui-verify` (45 tests), `scripts/demo-check.sh`, `goreleaser check`, exact-HEAD `make snapshot`, four-archive validator, and checksum count all pass. |

### Repository Standards

| Standard Area | Status | Evidence & Compliance Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cobra construction vs domain behavior | Verified | Canonical constructors reuse existing `AddProject`, `RemoveProject`, `UpdateProjects`, sync/reconcile, env, setup, mount, hosted, output, and locking paths. |
| Go coding standards | Verified | `make verify` includes `gofmt` enforcement, vet, golangci-lint (0 issues), govulncheck (no called vulnerabilities), tests, and build. |
| Testing patterns and isolation | Verified | Go built-in `testing` is used beside implementation; command/workflow tests use temporary `DEVSPACE_HOME`, workspaces, and local bare remotes. |
| JSON compatibility | Verified | Status, project list, sync diff/reconcile, setup show, and mount preview parse in tests and remain ANSI-free. |
| Local-first and explicit mutation | Verified | Demo proves sync moves metadata only; project updates, env writes, and setup execution remain separate explicit commands with safety checks. |
| Security boundaries | Verified | Env redaction/0600/atomic replacement, hosted public-bind/trusted-proxy guards, sync validation/backups/hash checks, and access advisories pass. |
| Documentation and CLI evidence | Verified | All CLI output changes have front-loaded text captures in Tasks 1-5 proofs; linked capstone HTML is regenerated and scanned. |
| Release workflow | Verified | Release-check builds four companions before GoReleaser, runs validator regression, and validates archives; local `make snapshot` now has the same ordering. |
| Git conventions and traceability | Verified | Conventional Commit-style commits form coherent Task 1-5 and validation remediation sequences through `789c4ba`; no unrelated core change found. |

### Proof Artifacts

| Unit/Task | Proof Artifact | Status | Verification Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 1 — command taxonomy/status | Root/status help and isolated status captures; command-tree/status tests; `13-task-01-proofs.md` | Verified | Proof is readable and summary-first; focused tests pass; root exposes exactly 14 grouped commands, removed roots are absent, and status JSON parses without ANSI. |
| Task 2 — sync/project | Isolated two-machine sync/update/untrack workflow; project CLI capture; sync/project regression tests; `13-task-02-proofs.md` | Verified | Focused tests and full suite pass; demo independently recreates metadata/placeholders and explicitly hydrates source; local files survive untrack. |
| Task 3 — env/setup/experimental | Masked env write/mode evidence; setup show/run captures; hosted/experimental help and mount preview; focused tests; `13-task-03-proofs.md` | Verified | Env, setup, hosted guards, and preview tests pass; no decrypted value appears; `.env` mode is 0600; removed secondary paths fail. |
| Task 4 — UI packaging | UI help/lookup tests; four archive listings; adjacent companion smoke; Go/TUI/release checks; `13-task-04-proofs.md` | Verified | Exact-HEAD snapshot succeeds with ko; all four archives contain executable matching binaries; 45 TUI tests and lookup/fallback tests pass. |
| Task 5 — docs/release | Maintained-surface scan; isolated demo; Go/TUI/GoReleaser checks; snapshot/archive proof; `13-task-05-proofs.md` | Verified | Scanner covers linked HTML plus wrapped/bare/inline negatives; demo and full gates pass; proof records review remediations and clean snapshot evidence. |

## Validation Issues

No open validation issues.

Two release-blocking gaps were discovered during Phase 4 and resolved before this PASS:

| Resolved Finding | Resolution | Re-verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean local snapshots did not build required TUI inputs before GoReleaser. | `f77ee5f` makes `snapshot` depend on `tui-build-all`; `0383c86` records clean-source proof and archive validation. | Clean exported-tree `make snapshot` succeeded; exact-HEAD `make snapshot` also completed GoReleaser and ko, then all four archives validated. |
| Linked capstone HTML was stale, and inline bare namespace mentions could escape the migration scanner. | `ea46166` regenerates/scans the linked HTML and adds negative inline fixtures plus a positive canonical fixture. | Production scanner and self-test pass; only the three bounded migration-table copies contain removed paths in the generated HTML. |
| FR8 help guidance was not enforced across every renamed/moved leaf, and a maintained architecture file remained outside the scanner. | `789c4ba` adds exact invocation/next-step examples and a 24-path help contract, migrates the architecture examples, and adds that file to the maintained allowlist. | Focused help/command tests, production scanner, self-test, full Go gate, and exact-HEAD release snapshot all pass. |
